Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
Prints its content line by line.
Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.

Functionality:
The program attempts to open sample.txt for reading.
Each line of the file is printed individually.
If the file does not exist, the program displays an error message:   Error: The file 'sample.txt' does not exist.


Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
Takes user input and writes it to a file named output.txt.
Appends additional data to the same file.
Reads and displays the final content of the file.

Functionality:
The program first prompts the user to enter some data, which is written to output.txt.
The user is then prompted to enter additional data, which is appended to the same file.
Finally, the program reads the file and displays its full content.
This demonstrates writing, appending, and reading from a file in Python.
